<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Amila</h1>


Welcome to my little developer corner ✨  
I see myself as a rookie **Frontend Developer** with a focus on **web design & development**.  
I began my coding journey by taking a Fullstack Developer course at CodeFactory in Vienna. I took a break from coding to work temporary in e-commerce. This valuable experience allowed me to strengthen my problem-solving and organizational skills, as well as better understand user needs and the challenges developers face. I continue to apply these skills in my coding projects.

Here I document my journey and the projects I build step by step.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a repository from scratch
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
      - Angular best practices  
      - WordPress plugin development  
      - Clean project structure with GitHub  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with creatives who have their focus on not only userfreindly but also aestetic websites
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with backend - symphony in particular
- 💬 Ask me about my favourite Linkin Park song
- 📫 How to reach me: ami.softic@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I mastered anything in life, then it is improvisation. Seriuosly, if there was something like it - I'd have a pHD.
