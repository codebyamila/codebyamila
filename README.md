## Hi, I'm Amila ðŸ‘‹




Welcome to my little developer corner âœ¨  
I see myself as a rookie **Frontend Developer** with a focus on **web design & development**.  
I began my coding journey by taking a Fullstack Developer course at CodeFactory in Vienna. I took a break from coding to work temporary in e-commerce. This valuable experience allowed me to strengthen my problem-solving and organizational skills, as well as better understand user needs and the challenges developers face. I continue to apply these skills in my coding projects.

Here I document my journey and the projects I build step by step.

 ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Angular  
- **CMS:** WordPress (getting started with plugin development)  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a repository from scratch


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
- Angular best practices  
- WordPress plugin development  
- Clean project structure with GitHub  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with creatives who have their focus on not only userfreindly but also aestetic websites
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with backend - symphony in particular
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favourite Linkin Park song

- âš¡ Fun fact: If I mastered anything in life, then it is improvisation. Seriuosly, if there was something like it - I'd have a pHD.
